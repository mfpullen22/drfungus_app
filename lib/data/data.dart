    description:
        "/Cryptococcus/ is an encapsulated yeast. Following its first identification in nature from peach juice samples, the major environmental sources of /Cryptococcus neoformans/ have been shown to be either soil contaminated with pigeon droppings (/Cryptococcus neoformans/ var. /neoformans/) or eucalyptus trees and decaying wood forming hollows in living trees (/Cryptococcus neoformans/ var. /gattii/). /Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii/ was also isolated from goats with pulmonary disease.",
    species:
        "The genus /Cryptococcus/ includes around 37 species. Among these, /Cryptococcus neoformans/ is the only species that is pathogenic and will be discussed in this entry. It has four serotypes (A to D). Serotyping is based on capsular agglutination reactions and can be detected by a dot enzyme assay. /Cryptococcus neoformans/ was generally accepted to include two varieties; var. /gattii/ and var. /neoformans/. Until recently and traditionally, serotypes A and D were included in var. /neoformans/ while serotypes B and D were included in var. /gattii/. However, in addition to the previously observed phenotypic differences, recent molecular studies have detected significant genetic variations between the two serotypes. Thus, it was recently proposed that a new variety, var. /grubii/, be created to contain serotype A. This leaves serotype D as the sole serotype in var. /neoformans/.\n\nThe two varieties, /neoformans/ and /gattii/ are morphologically similar, except that basidiospores of var. /neoformans/ are round and those of var. /gattii/ are more elliptical in shape. The definitive identification of the two varieties is possible by biochemical tests, such as resistance to canavanine, use of glycine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, and resistance of their urease enzymes to EDTA.\n\nAmong the other /Cryptococcus/ spp. are /Cryptococcus albidus/, /Cryptococcus laurentii/, /Cryptococcus terreus/, /Cryptococcus uniguttulatus/, /Cryptococcus luteolus/ and /Cryptococcus gastricus/.\n\nThe teleomorphic (sexual) reproductive phase of /Cryptococcus/ that occurs in nature constitutes the genus /Filobasidiella/. If the strains of serotypes A or D mate with each other, /Filobasidiella neoformans/ var. /neoformans is the teleomorph/. Similarly, the mating of serotypes B or C forms the teleomorph called /Filobasidiella neformans/ var. /bacillispora/.",
    clinical:
        "/Cryptococcus neoformans/ is the causative agent of cryptococcosis. Given the neurotropic nature of the fungus, the most common clinical form of cryptococcosis is meningoencephalitis. The course of the infection is usually subacute or chronic. Cryptococcosis may also involve the skin, lungs, prostate gland, urinary tract, eyes, myocardium, bones, and joints.\n\nThe most commonly encountered predisposing factor for development of cryptococcosis is AIDS. Less commonly, organ transplant recipients or cancer patients receiving chemotherapeutics or long-term corticosteroid treatment may develop cryptococcosis.\n\nThe polysaccharide capsule and phenol oxidase enzyme of /Cryptococcus neoformans/, as well as its ability to grow at 37°C, are its major virulence factors. Recent data suggest that phospholipase enzymes may also play a role as one of the potential virulence factors. The infection commonly starts following inhalation of the yeasts. Phenol oxidase enzyme functions in production of melanin. The melanizing enzyme presumably prevents formation of toxic hydroxy radicals and thus protects the fungal cell from oxidative stress as well as the immune defense mechanisms of the host.",
    features:
        "Colonies of /Cryptococcus neoformans/ are fast growing, soft, glistening to dull, smooth, usually mucoid, and cream to slightly pink or yellowish brown in color. The growth rate is somewhat slower than /Candida/ and usually takes 48 to 72 h. It grows well at 25°C as well as 37°C. Ability to grow at 37°C is one of the features that differentiates /Cryptococcus neoformans/ from other /Cryptococcus spp/. However, temperature-sensitive mutants that fail to grow at 37°C in vitro may also be observed. At 39-40°C, the growth of /Cryptococcus neoformans/ starts to slow down.\n\nOn cornmeal tween 80 agar, /Cryptococcus neoformans/ produces round, budding yeast cells. No true hyphae are visible. Pseudohyphae are usually absent or rudimentary. The capsule is best visible in India ink preparations. The thickness of the capsule is both strain-related and varies depending on the environmental conditions. Upon growth in 1% peptone solution, production of capsule is enhanced.\n\n/Cryptococcus neoformans/ should be differentiated from other clinically encountered yeasts, such as /Blastoschizomyces/, /Geotrichum/, /Malassezia/, /Rhodotorula/, /Saccharomyces/, and /Trichosporon/. Morphology on cornmeal tween 80 agar, capsule production, urease activity, ability to grow in presence of cycloheximide, growth pattern in Sabouraud broth, and fermentation assimilation profiles help in definitive identification of /Cryptococcus neoformans/.\n\nMicroscopically, globose to ovoid yeast cells that have a capsule, producing neither well-developed pseudohyphae nor true hyphae are typical for /Cryptococcus neoformans/. /Cryptococcus neoformans/ differs from /Candida/ by not forming well-developed pseudohyphae. The lack of arthroconidia differentiates it from /Trichosporon/ and /Geotrichum//, the two genera that produce abundant arthroconidia.\n\nBiochemically, the members of the genus /Cryptococcus/ are unable to ferment sugars, but do assimilate inositol and produce urease. Carotenoid pigment production is extremely variable. /Cryptococcus neoformans/ produces phenoloxidase enzyme that results in production of melanin and thus a brown to black discoloration of the colony when it is grown on caffeic acid agar or bird seed agar. /Cryptococcus/ differs from /Rhodotorula/ by assimilating inositol, and from /Candida glabrata/ by assimilating inositol and being urease positive.",
    precautions:
        "No special precautions other than general laboratory precautions are required.",
    susceptibility:
        "*_Amphotericin B and other polyenes:_*\nAmphotericin B exerts a fungicidal effect on /Cryptococcus neoformans/. As with /Candida spp./, the NCCLS method has difficulty distinguishing amphotericin B-resistant isolates from the susceptible ones. However, modifications of this method, such as the use of Antibiotic Medium 3 supplemented to 2% glucose (AM3) instead of the reference RPMI 1640 medium appear useful. Shaking the microplates during incubation also appears helpful.\n\nThere are also data indicating that minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) may be better predictors of clinical outcome than MICs. However, these modifications still require validation and standardization. Using E test method instead of NCCLS microdilution methodology may also enhance the detection of amphotericin B-resistant isolates, regardless of the test medium used. The other method under investigation, flow cytometry, in general yields rapid and correlated results with NCCLS reference method and for amphotericin B and fluconazole.\n\nVariety-related differences in susceptibility patterns have also been observed. /Cryptococcus neoformans/ var. /gattii/ appears less susceptible to amphotericin B and flucytosine than var. /neoformans/. Defects in sterol isomerase and depletion of ergosterol content in fungal cell membrane may result in emergence of resistance to amphotericin B.\n\nThe novel lipid nanosphere-encapsulated amphotericin B formulation, NS-718, generates very low MICs. Similar to amphotericin B, liposomal nystatin and the parent compound nystatin also show favorable in vitro activity against most /Cryptococcus neoformans/ isolates.\n\nPromisingly, amphotericin B combined with fluconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole yielded no antagonism in vitro and appeared synergistic for some isolates. In vitro synergy between amphotericin B and flucytosine or rifampin was observed for /Cryptococcus neoformans/ strains isolated from patients who failed to respond to amphotericin B therapy.\n\n*_Azoles:_*\nAzoles, particularly fluconazole and itraconazole, have been shown to have fungistatic effects against most /Cryptococcus neoformans/ isolates. Although most /Cryptococcus neoformans/ strains are susceptible to fluconazole, isolates with high MICs have been detected. Alternative susceptibility testing methods may yield results that differ sharply from the NCCLS reference method. Using Etest instead of the reference microdilution method has resulted in misclassification of a number of susceptible /Cryptococcus neoformans/ isolates as being resistant to fluconazole, itraconazole, and flucytosine. Colorimetric methods, on the other hand, might interpret some fluconazole- and flucytosine-resistant isolates as susceptible.\n\nSimilarly, most of the /Cryptococcus neoformans/ strains are susceptible to itraconazole in vitro. Among the newer azoles, posaconazole (SCH56592) appears most potent on a weight basis, when compared to voriconazole , fluconazole, itraconazole, and ketoconazole.\n\n*_Flucytosine:_*\nFlucytosine has long been used as part of combination therapy of cryptococcal infections. Resistance may develop during monotherapy. Use of yeast nitrogen base as the test medium was reported to be very effective in some investigators' hands in testing flucytosine susceptibility.\n\n*_Glucan Synthesis Inhibitors (Echinocandins):_*\nThese novel agents have essentially no activity against /Cryptococcus neoformans/. In vitro data suggest that activities of amphotericin B and fluconazole against /Cryptococcus neoformans/ may be enhanced by caspofungin.\n\n*_In Vivo Efficacy:_*\nThe most commonly used agents for treatment of cryptococcal infections are amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole, and particularly amphotericin B and flucytosine in combination. Fluconazole prophylaxis is also in common practice in patients who have recovered from cryptococcal infections. However, clinical failure with fluconazole has been reported. Fluconazole combined with flucytosine and triple therapy with amphotericin B, flucytosine, and fluconazole have been reported as effective. Itraconazole is less effective than fluconazole as maintenance therapy.",

  Drug(
    name: "Voriconazole (Vfend)",
    mechanism:
        "As with all azole antifungal agents, voriconazole works principally by inhibition of cytochrome P450 14a-demethylase. This enzyme is in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to ergosterol [1674, 1735]. Compared to fluconazole, voriconazole inhibits P45014DM to a greater extend. This inhibition is dose-dependent.",
    susceptibility:
        "Voriconazole has favorable in vitro activity against a variety of fungi. These include Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Fusarium spp., and Penicillium marneffei. Voriconazole is generally considered to be a fungistatic agent against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. It may, however, be fungicidal against Aspergillus spp.\n\nIts enhanced activity against fluconazole-resistant Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, and Candida guilliermondii is noteworthy. Some isolates which are resistant to fluconazole and/or itraconazole may, expectedly, exhibit cross-resistance to voriconazole. Zygomycetes, such as Mucor spp. and Rhizomucor spp. generate considerably high voriconazole MICs.",
    dosage:
        "Voriconazole is active following both oral and intravenous administrations. In clinical trials, oral (200 mg twice daily) and intravenous (3 to 6 mg/kg every 12 h) doses have produced favorable response. However, typical doses at individual clinical settings are not yet known. Parenteral administration can be followed by an oral course of voriconazole therapy.\n\nIt has oral and intravenous formulations.",
    adverse:
        "Dose-related, transient visual disturbances, skin rash and elevated hepatic enzyme levels have been reported.\n\nVisual disturbance is an interesting and extensively investigated side effect of voriconazole. It seems to be due to the blockage of receptor de-excitation by voriconazole. Patients experiencing visual disturbance during voriconazole therapy describe it in various forms; brightness, blurring, light sensitivity, or some changes in color vision. Typically, these visual abnormalities are seen in around 30% of patients receiving voriconazole, starts 30 minutes after the dose, and lasts about 30 minutes.",
    status:
        "Clinical use of voriconazole was approved by FDA in May 2002. It was approved for primary treatment of acute invasive aspergillosis and salvage therapy for rare but serious fungal infections caused by the pathogens Scedosporium apiospermum and Fusarium spp.\n\nIn 2005, voriconazole was also approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.",

      name: "Prospective Nationwide Online Registry of Endemic Mycoses",
      organization: "University of Minnesota",
      principal: "Dr. Matthew Pullen MD",
      description:
          "Endemic mycoses are a group of 7 important infections caused by thermally dimorphic fungi that are globally distributed based on specific environmental niches. Of these, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis are highly endemic in the United States. Recent data suggest that their incidences are rising and their geographic ranges are expanding; however, as these infections are not reportable, significant gaps exist in current knowledge of disease burden, geographic distribution, antifungal effectiveness, and long-term outcomes of patients.\n\nWe aim to create the first-ever Prospective Nationwide Online Registry of Endemic Mycoses, collecting unprecedented data on risk factors and patient reported outcomes from a geographically diverse populace throughout the United States. Using an internet-based approach, we will prospectively enroll persons with laboratory-confirmed endemic mycoses, utilizing a combination of physician networks, social media, and digital media outreach. We will leverage our experience in leading multiple nationwide COVID-19 virtual clinical trials to successfully engage research volunteers and physicians as stakeholders in participatory research so as to inform improved treatment strategies for endemic mycoses.\n\nSpecific Aim 1. To develop and maintain an electronic database of an internet-based, prospective nationwide cohort of patient-reported clinical outcomes for the endemic mycoses histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis.\n\nSpecific Aim 2. To determine the clinical effectiveness of consolidation therapy with itraconazole versus alternative azoles, as well as determine the risk factors for therapeutic failure or intolerance of consolidation therapy.\n\nSpecific Aim 3. To determine if mutations in the STAT1, STAT3, DECTIN-1, and IFNGR1 pathways confer increased risk of severe endemic mycoses infection as compared with mild/moderate severity.\n\nImpact: We expect that our internet-based registry will allow us to better define the incidence and geography of these endemic mycoses as well as the long-term outcomes and impact on the quality of life of patients. We expect to generate data on real-world effectiveness of itraconazole versus alternative azoles during consolidation and maintenance therapy to inform treatment guidelines and future randomized clinical trials for endemic mycoses therapy. We expect to identify clinical and host genetic risk factors associated with severe disease and therapeutic failure to improve clinical management and inform disease control strategies. Finally, we hope to maintain the endemic mycoses registry and the biorepository beyond the funding period, providing robust resources to advance the research agenda.",
